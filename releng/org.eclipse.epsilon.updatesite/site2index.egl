    <table border="1">
    <tr bgcolor="#666699" style="color:#ffffff">
      <th align="left">Feature</th>
      <th align="left">Version</th>
    </tr>
    [%for(feature in t_feature.all){%]
    <tr>
      <td>[%=feature.a_id%]</td>
      <td>[%=feature.a_version%]</td>
    </tr>
    [%}%]
    </table>

    <b>Note:</b> The last part of the version number (qualifier) is the date/time when the release
    was built (times in GMT zone). For example, if the version of a feature is 
    0.8.4.200902120929, it means that it is version 0.8.4 built at 09:29 on
    12/02/2009.
