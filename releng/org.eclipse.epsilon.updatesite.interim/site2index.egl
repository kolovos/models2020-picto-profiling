    <h2>Epsilon Interim Update Site</h2>
    This site is designed to be used through the Eclipse update manager, which is accessible
    within Eclipse under <b>Help->Software Updates</b>.
    
    <p>
	    <b><font color="red">Caution: </font></b>
	    This is an interim update site, which means that the version
	    available here contains the latest features of Epsilon but 
	    some of them may not have been properly tested yet. For the latest stable 
	    version of Epsilon, please use the <a href="https://download.eclipse.org/epsilon/updates/">main update site</a> instead.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Features</h2>
    <table border="1">
    <tr bgcolor="#666699" style="color:#ffffff">
      <th align="left">Feature</th>
      <th align="left">Version</th>
    </tr>
    [%for(feature in t_feature.all){%]
    <tr>
      <td>[%=feature.a_id%]</td>
      <td>[%=feature.a_version%]</td>
    </tr>
    [%}%]
    </table>
    <br/>
    <b>Note:</b> The last part of the version number (qualifier) is the date/time when the release
    was built (times in GMT zone). For example, if the version of a feature is 
    0.8.4.200902120929, it means that it is version 0.8.4 built at 09:29 on
    12/02/2009.
