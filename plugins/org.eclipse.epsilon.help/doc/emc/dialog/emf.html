      <h1>
         Using EMF models with Epsilon programs
      </h1>
      <p>
         Epsilon can be used with a range of modelling technologies, including EMF, MDR and plain XML.
         Before launching an Epsilon program, the models to be consumed or produced by the program
         must be specified. This article describes the way in which Epsilon programs can be 
         configured to access EMF models.  
      </p>
      
      <p>
      	When launching an Epsilon program, the launch configuration dialog includes a "models" tab.
      	To configure an Epsilon program to use an EMF model, click the "models" tab, click "Add",
      	and select "EMF Model". 
      </p>
      
      <p>
      	The resulting dialog box contains several options that are used to specify how Epsilon
      	will access the model at run-time:
      </p>
      
      <dl>
        <dt>Name</dt>
        <dd>The identifier used to access this model from the Epsilon program.</dd>
        
        <dt>Aliases</dt>
        <dd>Additional identifiers for accessing this model.</dd>
        
        <dt>Meta-model is file-based</dt>
        <dd>
            If checked, indicates that Epsilon should load the metamodel from a location in this workspace.
            If unchecked, indicates that Epsilon should load the metamodel via EMF's package registry, which
            allows access to metamodels defined in workspace plug-ins (such as the UML metamodel).
        </dd>
        
        <dt>Include external references</dt>
        <dd>
            Indicates whether Epsilon should load any models that are referenced by this model.
        </dd>
        
        <dt>Model file</dt>
        <dd>
            The location of the EMF model in the workspace.
        </dd>
        
        <dt>Meta-model file</dt>
        <dd>
            The location of the metamodel (Ecore file) in the workspace.
        </dd>
        
        <dt>Meta-model URI</dt>
        <dd>
            The EMF namespace URI of the metamodel.
        </dd>
        
        <dt>Read on load</dt>
        <dd>
            Indicates whether the model will be loaded before the Epsilon program is executed.
            Typically, this should be turned off only when the model is to be created by the
            Epsilon program.
        </dd>
        
        <dt>Store on disposal</dt>
        <dd>
            Indicates whether any changes made to the model by the Epsilon program should be
            saved. When this option is turned off, Epsilon has read-only access to the model.
        </dd>
      </dl>
