      <h1>
         Using HUTN with Epsilon programs
      </h1>
      <p>
         Epsilon can be used with a range of modelling technologies, including EMF, MDR and plain XML.
         Before launching an Epsilon program, the models to be consumed or produced by the program
         must be specified. This article describes the way in which Epsilon programs can be 
         configured to use EMF models specified in Epsilon HUTN.  
      </p>
      
      <p>
      	When launching an Epsilon program, the launch configuration dialog includes a "models" tab.
      	To configure an Epsilon program to use HUTN as a model, click the "models" tab, click "Add",
      	and select "EMF model expressed in HUTN." 
      </p>
      
      <p>
      	The resulting dialog box contains several options that are used to specify how Epsilon
      	will access the model at run-time:
      </p>
      
      <dl>
        <dt>Name</dt>
        <dd>The identifier used to access this model from the Epsilon program.</dd>
        
        <dt>Aliases</dt>
        <dd>Additional identifiers for accessing this model.</dd>
        
        <dt>HUTN File</dt>
        <dd>
            The location of the HUTN source file in this workspace.
        </dd>
        
        <dt>Read on load</dt>
        <dd>
            Indicates whether the model will be loaded before the Epsilon program is executed.
            Typically, this should be turned off only when the model is to be created by the
            Epsilon program.
        </dd>
        
        <dt>Store on disposal</dt>
        <dd>
            Indicates whether any changes made to the model by the Epsilon program should be
            saved. When this option is turned off, Epsilon has read-only access to the model.
        </dd>
      </dl>
