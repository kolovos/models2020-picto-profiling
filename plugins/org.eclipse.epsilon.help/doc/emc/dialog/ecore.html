      <h1>
         Using an EMF package as a model with Epsilon programs
      </h1>
      <p>
         Epsilon can be used with a range of modelling technologies, including EMF, MDR and plain XML.
         Before launching an Epsilon program, the models to be consumed or produced by the program
         must be specified. This article describes the way in which Epsilon programs can be 
         configured to access an EMF package (i.e. an EMF metamodel), treating it as a model.  
      </p>
      
      <p>
      	When launching an Epsilon program, the launch configuration dialog includes a "models" tab.
      	To configure an Epsilon program to use an EMF package as a model, click the "models" tab, 
      	click "Add", and select "Registered EMF EPackage." 
      </p>
      
      <p>
      	The resulting dialog box contains several options that are used to specify how Epsilon
      	will access the model at run-time:
      </p>
      
      <dl>
        <dt>Name</dt>
        <dd>The identifier used to access this model from the Epsilon program.</dd>
        
        <dt>Aliases</dt>
        <dd>Additional identifiers for accessing this model.</dd>
        
        <dt>File</dt>
        <dd>
            The location of the XML document in this workspace.
        </dd>
        
        <dt>Meta-model URI</dt>
        <dd>
            The EMF namespace URI of the EMF EPackage (metamodel).
        </dd>
      </dl>
