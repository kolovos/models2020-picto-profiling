      <h1>
         Configuring the Type of Template Factory for EGL programs
      </h1>
     <p>
      	EGL provides the built-in TemplateFactory object for use in any EGL program.
      	The TemplateFactory object is used to create, load and process EGL templates.
      	By default, EGL will provide an instance of the EglFileGeneratingTemplateFactory
      	as the built-in TemplateFactory object, which is able to generate text to the 
      	file system. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        To change the way in which templates are created, loaded or processed, a custom
        type of TemplateFactory can be used. For example, it might be desirable to perform
        some pre- or post-processing whenever a template is processed, or to construct
        templates capable of generating text to destinations other than the file system
        (e.g. a network socket or as a query to a database management system).
      </p>
      
      <p>
      	To change the type of template factory for this EGL program, select the desired template
      	factory type from the combo box under the "Type of Template Factory" group of the 
      	"Generated Text" tab.
      </p> 
      
      <p>
        You can define a custom templateFactoryType by providing a plug-in that contributes to the
        following extension point:
        
        <pre><code>org.eclipse.epsilon.egl.dt.templateFactoryType</code></pre>
